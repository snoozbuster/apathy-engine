Apathy Engine
=============

My personal engine for use in XNA games. Feel free to use it as you see fit.

### Dependancies
- [XNA Framework 4.0](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23714) (It's possible that you could compile against MonoGame, though)
- [BEPUphysics 1.3.0](http://bepuphysics.codeplex.com)

More to come.
